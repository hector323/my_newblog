Instructions: 

Initially adding files: To add your existing work to a GitHub-created repo, simply copy over all your homework files into the repo created by the git clone, and 
then do the git add -A 
git commit -m, 
git push to send it over to GitHub. 
You can copy it over using the Terminal, or just by using your file browser. Do not use GitHub's upload feature.


Pull request: It's okay to merge up your pull-requests immediately after creating them.

Bash & Python: These two static site generators will be identical in function. With HW3 and beyond, we will only be working on improving the Python one.

Pushing a new branch: When you do a git push on a brand new branch, git will complain about it not existing on GitHub yet. It will also suggest a command for you to run, saying something about --set-upstream. All you need to do is copy and paste that full command it suggests, and it will then work. Also, all subsequent git push attempts on that new branch will also work, yay.
